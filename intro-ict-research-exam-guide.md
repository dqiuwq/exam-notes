### **Topic 1** : What is ICT Research?
### learning outcomes
* what is research?
* what types of research occurs in ict?
* what is a project? what is a research project?
* what are usually the main stages in a research project?
* what are these research approaches?

> **what is `research`?** *it is the creation of new knowledge, using an appropriate process.
> the definition of research are generally to do with observing and describing, predicting and determining causes.*

**types of Research**
* exploratory research - *To get a better understanding, test the feasibility or determine the best method to be used in a subsequent study. Main objective is to identify key issues and key variables.*
* descriptive research - *To study on something new or something that people are not aware about. It is directed towards answering questions such as what is this? e.g. what is covid19?*
* explanatory research - *To understand or to explain relationships between targeted variables. Often uses correlations to study relationships between characteristics off individuals, groups, situations or events.*

> **scientific or academic research** - *an investigation on the basic principles and reasons for occurence of a particular event or process or phenomenon. Also known as theoretical research. Note that a research does not concern with solving any practical problems of immediate interest. It basically provides a systematic and deep insight into a problem and facilitates extraction of scientific and logical explanation and clusion on the topic.*

> **ict research** - *the creation of new knowledge in any area of ICT*

> **project** vs **research Project** - *it is a temporary sequence of unique and connected activites having one goal or purpose and that must be completed by a specific time, within budget, and according to specification.*
> *A research project is a project where the goal or purpose is to **create new knowledge***

**research project phases** ***be prepared to describe each phase..*
* read relevant literature
* define research problem
* design research
* collect data
* analyse data
* report findings

**types of research approaches**
* survey - *collects the same data from a large group of people*
    * data can be `quantitative` or `qualitative`
    * data collection must be designed and administered to minimise bias so that data can be effectively analysed
    * used frequently in information systems
    * some examples include unit surveys, market research
* design and creation - *focuses on developing new products*
    * products can be a system or it can be a development process, method or model
    * some examples includes intelligent systems, network protocols, development methodologies
* experiment - *designed to find relationships between selected variables in an environment*
    * either a laboratory-based or field experiments
    * some examples include human computer interface (HCI) studies, system performance comparisons, pair-programming vs solo etc
* case study - *focuses on one or a few instances of an interest*
    * cases can be anything from organisations, systems, projects, events
    * studies in depth using multiple methods of data collection
    * some examples include reasons for user resistance to new type of system, problems with system development methodologies
* action research - *focuses on practical issues or fact findings to improve the quality of action*
    * it has both `practical outcomes` as well as `research outcomes` (2 outcomes)
    * it is similar to case study approach except that it involves the active contribution of the researcher to the situation being studied.
    * some examples include improving employees' compliance with security policies, improving business processing via introduction of tablets

### **Topic 2** : Introduction to Project Management
### learning outcomes
* what is project management?
* why is project management so important?
* what is PMBOK and what are the knowledge areas it contains?
* what are the project management process groups?
* ~~can you create a scope statement?~~
* ~~can you use microsoft project to develop a gantt chart?~~

> **what is a `project`?**  
> *It is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.*  
> *`Characteristics` of a project includes unique purpose, temporary, requires resources, involves uncertainty or risk and has a deliverable.*

> **what is `project management`?**
> *Applies knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to manage activities and processes to improve project outcomes.*  
> *The key to project `success` is to deliver the project within time constraints, budget, and according to specification.*

**why do you need project management?** - *Supports the project team in answering questions like..*  
* what tasks must be performed? in what order to produce the deliverable of the project?
* when should each task be performed?
* who will completed the task?
* what resources are required?
* how much time is available or required for a task?
* what is the best way to communicate project details to those with an interest in the project? (e.g. stakeholders)

**tools and techniques**
* project charters, scope statements and stakeholder matrix
* work breakdown structure (WBS), gantt chart, network diagrams
* cost estimates and human resource plans

> **what is `PMBOK`?**  
> *Provides a base of standards, procedures and best practices for managing all types of projects and is used by many organisations to apply project management principles to projects.*

**`PMBOK` knowledge areas**
1. scope statement
2. time management
3. cost management
4. quality management
5. human resource management
6. communications management
7. risk management
8. procurement management
9. stakeholder management
10. integration management

**`project management` process groups** - *a logical grouping of project management inputs, tools,  techniques and outputs*
1. initiating
    * establishes the project scope with stakeholders and identify constraints e.g. project charter
    * scope - *boundaries of the project*
    * constraints - *trade off between scope, cost, time and quality*
        * scope - how much you can actually do with the time available
        * cost - how much you can afford to spend
        * how - much time you got to deliver it
        * quality - the level of quality of the deliverable
2. planning
    * purpose is to guide the execution of the project
    * includes processes from every knowledge area e.g. planning schedules, resources, costs, human resources etc
    * outputs from this phase include 
        * `scope statement` - a document used to develop a common understanding between stakeholders which includes the project justification (why?), brief description of the requirements and deliverables, project success criteria, assumptions and constraints.
        * `work breakdown structure (wbs)` - a hierarchical grouping of work or task involved in a project in order to deliver the project.
        * scheduling - shows the durations and interdependencies of each task e.g. the start or completetion of an individual task may depend on the start or completion of another task.
            * `gantt chart` - a simple horizontal bar chart that depicts project tasks against a calendar
            * `network diagram` -  a graphical network model that depicts a projects tasks and relationship between those tasks
3. executing
    * involves managing and performing the work descried in the project plan
    * a `milestone report` can keep the focus on completing major milestones
4. monitoring and controlling
    * involves measuring progress towards the project objectives, monitoring deviation from the plan, and taking corrective actions to match progress with the plan.
    * this is needed during all phases of the project
    * output includes `performance reports`, requested changes and updates to various plans
    * `baseline` - the approved project management plan plus approved changes
    * this can be done using the `tracking gantt` from microsoft projects
5. closing
    * in order to close a project, we must finalised all activities and transfer the completed or cancelled work to the appropriate people.
        * involves gaining stakeholder and customer acceptance of the final product or services.
        * if project is not completed, there should be a formal closure in order to reflect on what can be learned from the past and to improve on future projects.
        * output includes `project archives` and `lessons learned report`
        * most projects will include a final report or a presentation

___

### **Topic 3** : Literature Review
### learning outcomes
* what are the objectives of a literature review
* ~~can you find and obtain relevant published literature?~~
* ~~can you cite references using IEEE and APA styles?~~
* what are the main types of information that a write up of a research project should include?
* how do the goals of oral presentations and written reports of research differ?

**`recap`: project research phases** *read relevant literature*

![research project phases](resources\images\research-project-phases.jpg)

> **what is a `literature review`?**
> *a critical anlaysis of published sources or literatures of a topic. the output of the review should describe, summarise, synthesise and evaluate the featured literatures.*

>**purpose of `literature review`**  
> *useful to gather knowledge about a topic, specifically to find out what has been research. it can be help to develop a broad conceptual context into a research.*

**steps to conduct during a lit review**
* search for literatures
* obtain materials (hard/soft)
* assess the credibility
* read and understand
* critically evaluate the quality
* record the bibliographic details
> **literature review as standalone**
> *enables others to understand the field, point to strengths, weaknesses, omissions or bias in the previous work, point to gaps that have not previously been identified or addressed.*  
> **literature review in research paper**
> *establish the need for a research, place the researcher's work in the context of what has already been published, introduce the theories, relevant methodologies or strategies that will be used in the research.*

**structure of research papers**
* beginning - *title, author, abstract, keywords*
* middle - *introduction, lit review, research methodology, results, discussion which includes limitations, implications, future research.*
* end - *references, appendices*

___

### **Topic 4** : Scientific Investigation
### learning outcomes
* what is explanatory research?
* what is a variable?
* how to independent and dependent variables differ?
* what is a hypothesis?
* what is a theory?
* what is a model?
* can you generat a hypothesis based on a research question?  

### `extended` learning for exams
* create a research question
* create a hypothesis
* identify iv and dv

**`recap`: project research phases** *define research problem*

![research project phases](resources\images\research-project-phases.jpg)

**`research question` / aka rq**  
**some examples:**
* what factors influence a user's security behaviour?
* why are users susceptible to phishing attacks?
* if there aren't any explicit rq, a clear research `aim` or `objective` should be established.
    * to find an effective way to train people to identify and avoid phishing web sites.
    * `aim` - *what are you going to do*
    * `objective` - *so that you can fulfil that*
* *prepare more examples for exam..*

**explanatory research** - *trying to establish cause and effect*

may include:
* `variables` - *can be any value that varies (e.g. quantity or quality)*
    * `dependent` variables - *the variable that a researcher is interested in.*
        * changes as a result from the change on iv (`effect`)
    * `independent` variables - *the variable that is believed to affect the dependent variable.*
        * changes one or more dv (`cause`)
    * operational definitions such as processor speed (mghz) or weight (mg/g/kg)
* `hypotheses` - *a statement about the relationship between the iv and dv*
    * the relationship in a hypothesis specifies how the value of one variable changes in relation to another.
        * *the relationship may be positive or negative or the variables may have no relationship to one another (aka null hypotheses h0)*
    * some examples:
        * *h1 - `system quality` positively affects `user satisfaction` with the system*
            * iv - system quality
            * dv - user satisfaction
        * *h2 - the perceived threat severity of an outdated browser will influence a user's intention to update the browser*
    * ***`note: hypotheses are usually derived from, and justified by the literature that has been reviewd.`***
    * types of hypotheses
        * `null` - *there are no gender differences in levels of internet use*
        * `non-directional` - *there are gender differences in levels of internet use*
        * `directional` - *males have higher levels of internet use than females*
            * which is the iv and dv?
* `theories` - *an interrelated set of statements of relationship whose purpose is to explain and predict* 
* `models` - *represents a situation or system and it is used to help understand it (framework?)*
    * some [examples](https://is.theorizeit.org/wiki/Main_Page) for theories and models

**sample exam question**
> The Internet of Things (IoT) provides huge potential benefits, yet has privacy and security issues. You are interested in how potential users’ perceptions of the risks influence their intentions to acquire IoT devices.  
>
> Identify a research question and hypothesis for a research study you might undertake to investigate one aspect of this issue. Label the independent variable and the dependent variable in your hypothesis.
