### **Topic 1** : What is ICT Research?
### learning outcomes
* what is research?
* what types of research occurs in ict?
* what is a project? what is a research project?
* what are usually the main stages in a research project?
* what are these research approaches?

> **what is `research`?** *it is the creation of new knowledge, using an appropriate process.
> the definition of research are generally to do with observing and describing, predicting and determining causes.*

**types of Research**
* exploratory research - *To get a better understanding, test the feasibility or determine the best method to be used in a subsequent study. Main objective is to identify key issues and key variables.*
* descriptive research - *To study on something new or something that people are not aware about. It is directed towards answering questions such as what is this? e.g. what is covid19?*
* explanatory research - *To understand or to explain relationships between targeted variables. Often uses correlations to study relationships between characteristics off individuals, groups, situations or events.*

> **scientific or academic research** - *an investigation on the basic principles and reasons for occurence of a particular event or process or phenomenon. Also known as theoretical research. Note that a research does not concern with solving any practical problems of immediate interest. It basically provides a systematic and deep insight into a problem and facilitates extraction of scientific and logical explanation and clusion on the topic.*

> **ict research** - *the creation of new knowledge in any area of ICT*

> **project** vs **research Project** - *it is a temporary sequence of unique and connected activites having one goal or purpose and that must be completed by a specific time, within budget, and according to specification.*
> *A research project is a project where the goal or purpose is to **create new knowledge***

**research project phases** ***be prepared to describe each phase..*
* read relevant literature - *(topic 3)*
* `define research problem` - *this is the phase whereby you define your problem statement along with the variables involved (`independent/dependent`), `hypotheses`, `theories` and `models`. if there are no specific questions, you should then define your research aim or objective clearly. (topic 4)*
* `design research` - 
* `collect data` - 
* `analyse data` - 
* `report findings` - 

> **sample question**   
>A research project commonly includes the following phases: define research problem, design research, collect data, analyse data and report findings.   
>
> In your own words, briefly describe what **`occurs`** in each of these phases.

**types of research approaches**
* survey - *collects the same data from a large group of people*
    * data can be `quantitative` or `qualitative`
    * data collection must be designed and administered to minimise bias so that data can be effectively analysed
    * used frequently in information systems
    * some examples include unit surveys, market research
* design and creation - *focuses on developing new products*
    * products can be a system or it can be a development process, method or model
    * some examples includes intelligent systems, network protocols, development methodologies
* experiment - *designed to find relationships between selected variables in an environment*
    * either a laboratory-based or field experiments
    * some examples include human computer interface (HCI) studies, system performance comparisons, pair-programming vs solo etc
* case study - *focuses on one or a few instances of an interest*
    * cases can be anything from organisations, systems, projects, events
    * studies in depth using multiple methods of data collection
    * some examples include reasons for user resistance to new type of system, problems with system development methodologies
* action research - *focuses on practical issues or fact findings to improve the quality of action*
    * it has both `practical outcomes` as well as `research outcomes` (2 outcomes)
    * it is similar to case study approach except that it involves the active contribution of the researcher to the situation being studied.
    * some examples include improving employees' compliance with security policies, improving business processing via introduction of tablets

### **Topic 2** : Introduction to Project Management
### learning outcomes
* what is project management?
* why is project management so important?
* what is PMBOK and what are the knowledge areas it contains?
* what are the project management process groups?
* ~~can you create a scope statement?~~
* ~~can you use microsoft project to develop a gantt chart?~~

> **what is a `project`?**  
> *It is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.*  
> *`Characteristics` of a project includes unique purpose, temporary, requires resources, involves uncertainty or risk and has a deliverable.*

> **what is `project management`?**
> *Applies knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to manage activities and processes to improve project outcomes.*  
> *The key to project `success` is to deliver the project within time constraints, budget, and according to specification.*

**why do you need project management?** - *Supports the project team in answering questions like..*  
* what tasks must be performed? in what order to produce the deliverable of the project?
* when should each task be performed?
* who will completed the task?
* what resources are required?
* how much time is available or required for a task?
* what is the best way to communicate project details to those with an interest in the project? (e.g. stakeholders)

**tools and techniques**
* project charters, scope statements and stakeholder matrix
* work breakdown structure (WBS), gantt chart, network diagrams
* cost estimates and human resource plans

> **what is `PMBOK`?**  
> *Provides a base of standards, procedures and best practices for managing all types of projects and is used by many organisations to apply project management principles to projects.*

**`PMBOK` knowledge areas**
1. scope statement
2. time management
3. cost management
4. quality management
5. human resource management
6. communications management
7. risk management
8. procurement management
9. stakeholder management
10. integration management

**`project management` process groups** - *a logical grouping of project management inputs, tools,  techniques and outputs*
1. initiating
    * establishes the project scope with stakeholders and identify constraints e.g. project charter
    * scope - *boundaries of the project*
    * constraints - *trade off between scope, cost, time and quality*
        * scope - how much you can actually do with the time available
        * cost - how much you can afford to spend
        * how - much time you got to deliver it
        * quality - the level of quality of the deliverable
2. planning
    * purpose is to guide the execution of the project
    * includes processes from every knowledge area e.g. planning schedules, resources, costs, human resources etc
    * outputs from this phase include 
        * `scope statement` - a document used to develop a common understanding between stakeholders which includes the project justification (why?), brief description of the requirements and deliverables, project success criteria, assumptions and constraints.
        * `work breakdown structure (wbs)` - a hierarchical grouping of work or task involved in a project in order to deliver the project.
        * scheduling - shows the durations and interdependencies of each task e.g. the start or completetion of an individual task may depend on the start or completion of another task.
            * `gantt chart` - a simple horizontal bar chart that depicts project tasks against a calendar
            * `network diagram` -  a graphical network model that depicts a projects tasks and relationship between those tasks
3. executing
    * involves managing and performing the work descried in the project plan
    * a `milestone report` can keep the focus on completing major milestones
4. monitoring and controlling
    * involves measuring progress towards the project objectives, monitoring deviation from the plan, and taking corrective actions to match progress with the plan.
    * this is needed during all phases of the project
    * output includes `performance reports`, requested changes and updates to various plans
    * `baseline` - the approved project management plan plus approved changes
    * this can be done using the `tracking gantt` from microsoft projects
5. closing
    * in order to close a project, we must finalised all activities and transfer the completed or cancelled work to the appropriate people.
        * involves gaining stakeholder and customer acceptance of the final product or services.
        * if project is not completed, there should be a formal closure in order to reflect on what can be learned from the past and to improve on future projects.
        * output includes `project archives` and `lessons learned report`
        * most projects will include a final report or a presentation

>**sample question**  
>*“A project’s schedule depends only on the project’s task durations”. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Explain your response.*  
>I `disagree` with this statement because a project has a planned schedule or a deadline to deliver the output and the list of tasks will then be allocated based on the available time and resources given to the project. However, it is also true that the actual duration can be affected by the actual task completion date and time, as a result the project also somehow relies on the task durations.

___

**`recap`: project research phases** -> *define research problem*

![research project phases](resources/images/research-project-phases.jpg)

**`research question` / aka rq**  

**some examples:**
* what factors influence a user's security behaviour?
* why are users susceptible to phishing attacks?
* if there aren't any explicit rq, a clear research `aim` or `objective` should be established.
    * to find an effective way to train people to identify and avoid phishing web sites.
    * `aim` - *what are you going to do*
    * `objective` - *so that you can fulfil that*
* *prepare more examples for exam..*

**explanatory research** - *trying to establish cause and effect*

    * `dependent` variables - *the variable that a researcher is interested in.*
        * changes as a result from the change on iv (`effect`)
    * `independent` variables - *the variable that is believed to affect the dependent variable.*
        * changes one or more dv (`cause`)
    * operational definitions such as processor speed (mghz) or weight (mg/g/kg)
* `hypotheses` - *a statement about the relationship between the iv and dv*
    * the relationship in a hypothesis specifies how the value of one variable changes in relation to another.
        * *the relationship may be positive or negative or the variables may have no relationship to one another (aka null hypotheses h0)*
    * some examples:
        * *h1 - `system quality` positively affects `user satisfaction` with the system*
            * iv - system quality
            * dv - user satisfaction
        * *h2 - the perceived threat severity of an outdated browser will influence a user's intention to update the browser*
    * ***`note: hypotheses are usually derived from, and justified by the literature that has been reviewd.`***
    * types of hypotheses
        * `null` - *there are no gender differences in levels of internet use*
        * `non-directional` - *there are gender differences in levels of internet use*
        * `directional` - *males have higher levels of internet use than females*
            * which is the iv and dv?
* `theories` - *an interrelated set of statements of relationship whose purpose is to explain and predict* 
* `models` - *represents a situation or system and it is used to help understand it (framework?)*
    * some [examples](https://is.theorizeit.org/wiki/Main_Page) for theories and models

> **sample question 1**  
> The Internet of Things (IoT) provides huge potential benefits, yet has privacy and security issues. You are interested in how potential users’ perceptions of the risks influence their intentions to acquire IoT devices.  
>

## **Topic 7** : Conducting Survey Research
### learning outcomes
* what is survey research?
* what are the main approaches used to collect data in survey research?
* how does a research sample differ from a target population?
* what is a sampling frame?
* why are pre-testing and pilot testing used?
* how do probability and non-probability sampling techniques differ?
* what are the advantages of survey research?
* what are the disadvantages of survey research?

> *A `survey` is about finding perception, it tells you what is going on, not telling you why.*

**`recap`: project research phases** -> *design research & collect data*

![research project phases](resources/images/research-project-phases.jpg)

**design research** - after the research question or problem has been specified, we will determine how the aims will be achieved and have the research questions answered.

**types of research strategy or approach:**
* survey
* design and creation
* experiment
* case study
* action research

**survey** - obtaining the same kinds of data from a large group of entitiles, people or events in a systematic way.

**there are serveral ways to generate data using survey such as:**
* quantitative
    * questionnaires
    * interviews
* qualitative
    * observation
    * document analysis

**steps for planning a survey research**
* decide on data requirements - *what data will be needed to answer the research questions?*
* decide on data generation method - *questionnaires/interviews/observation/document analysis*
* obtain `sampling frame`
* determine `sampling technique`
* design data collection instruments

**questionnaires** - printed/online questionnaires or face-to-face/telephone interviews

**designing questionnaires**
* form of administration - *self-administered or researcher-administered*
* list or type of questions
    * open questions or close questions
    * types of scale (yes/no, quantity, agree/disagree)
* layout and structure - *explain purpose, how to complete and return*

**3 key terms:**
1. population of interest - *the groupd that you want to generalise your study to.*
    * trying to find out the voters of singapore citizens
    * whole population of singapore is 5 mil, this is the population of interest.
2. sampling frame - *the list from which sample will be drawn upon. this should contain the whole population of interest*
    * for statically study, choosing a sampling size
    * find a list of people that you can get in touch to do my study
3. sample - *the actual size that you are collecting data from.*
    * picking the sample size from sampling (sub set of sampling size e.g sampling frame=1000 sample=500) size should be smaller than or equal to sampling frame.

**sampling techniques**
* `probability sampling techniques` - *every element in the population has a known non-zero probability of selection.*
    * random sampling - *samples are randomly selected from population of interest. every item in the population has the same probability of being in the sample.*
    * variations - *random selection at some point*
        * systematic sampling - *getting a sample by intervals*
        > the randomness is the order of the list and  the number that you pick
        * stratified sampling - *getting a sample by profiles*
        > the key is to strike a balance in profile e.g. forming a team by major of students
        * cluster sampling - *getting subset of whole population*
        > e.g. height of all singapore citizens in areas of singapore (e.g. woodlands, jurong etc.)  
        > e.g. find the sample using generalisation by an area
* `non-probability sampling techniques` - *probability of any member of the population being chosen is unknown*
    * purposive sampling - *deliberately hand-pick samples*
    > e.g. someone of this profile to be part of my study or not you will but by change you will be.
    * snowball sampling - *find one person from the target population, then ask for recommendations on potential candidates that are relevant to the research.*
    > dead end is when someone who refuse to give you contact
    * convenience sampling - *researchers simply select respondents who are convenient for them (e.g. easy to reach or willing to help)*
    > e.g. i am a tutor who has access to students of my class

>**sampling size** - actual sample size is also influenced by response rate.

**testing before collecting of data** - *to check if the question is easy or hard to understand?*
* pre-test - group of potential respondents to identify any problems with questions
* pilot-test - trail all procedures and instruments to ensure test is ready for study

**advantages of survey research**
* can provide a wide coverage
* affortable and cheaper than other approaches
* collects data faster than other approaches
* studies can be replicated relatively easily as measurements can be reused
* can determine the relationships between the variables

**disadvantages of survey research**
* results may lack depth
* may be an overemphasis on what can be counted and measured quantitatively
* snapshot of points in time (e.g. the time that the survey was taken may influence the results)
* does not establish cause and effect
* does not provide as rich description of a situation as case study research

## **Topic 8** : Conducting ICT Experiments
### learning outcomes
* what is an experiment?
* why would a control group be used in an experiment?
* why is it good to randomly allocate participants to experiment groups?
* what is the difference between a true experiment and a quasi-experiment?
* what is an experimental design?
* what is the main advantage of experimentation as a research strategy?
* what decisions need to be made when designing an experiment?
* wat are internal and external validity?

> **what is an experiment** - *involves observation undert controlled conditions to test a `hypothesis`. it is one of the research strategies that investigates `cause and effect` of the relationship, also known as cauality, between variables namely, independent and dependent.
> 
> *all factors that may affect the results except factors that are hypothesised are excluded or controlled.*
> objective of experiment - *to manipulate the `independent` variable(s) to observe changes in the `dependent` variable while controlling other factors.*

**recap `hypotheses`** - *a statement about the relationships between variables.*

**causality vs correlation**
* `correlation` - *when there is a relationship between two variables*
    * e.g. when this increase, that increase
* `causality` - *when the change in one variable is the *cause* of a change in another variable*
    * e.g. when this change, this will change that

> **quick questions**  
> which of the following hypotheses express a causal relationship?  
> * h1: level of use is associated with user satisfaction with a system  
> * h2: pair programming improves program quality
> * h3: users who receive password memorisation training will create stronger passwords  
> * h4:	users who believe they are vulnerable to security threats are more likely to believe that  threats will be severe  
> ans: h1,h2,h3

**why researchers prefer using experiments to answer research questions?**

here are some of the characteristics of an experiment:
* precise observations and measurements
* proving or disproving hypotheses
* identification of causal factors e.g. one direction links
* explanation and prediction
* repetition

![cause-effect-iv-dv](resources/images/iv-dv.png)

**purpose of controlling variables and the environment** - *isolate the elements from other variables so that there is no interference and no disruption to the experiment.*
* eliminate the factor via exclusion criteria
* hold the factor constant via inclusion criteria (if you cannot eliminate it)
* use random selection or allocation
* use a control group - *the difference from treatment group is the change in independent variable*

![unwanted-factor-cause-effect](resources/images/unwanted.png)

**random sampling vs random allocation**
* random sampling - *samples that are randomly picked from the population of interest which also tells us that each item in the population has the same probability of being in the sample.*
* random allocation - *allocation to experimental groups from the whole sample is random*
    * `usually random sampling is done first then followed up random allocation`

> **benefits of random sampling or allocation**
> *Random assignment of participants helps to ensure that any differences between and within the groups are not systematic at the outset of the experiment. Thus, any differences between groups recorded at the end of the experiment can be more confidently attributed to the experimental procedures or treatment.* [*Source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment)

> **importance of random sampling**
> *Random assignment ensures that participants in a cause and effect study are unbiased as it prevents people’s history from causing an extraneous variable within the experiment.* [*Source*](https://dunekahnshillan.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/the-importance-of-random-assignment-in-creating-experiments/)

**validity** - *measuring what the researchers set out to measure.*
* internal - 
    * threats
        * differences between the experimental and control group
        * historical events
        * maturation - *impact of time as a variable in a study*
        * instrumentation
        * experimental mortality
        * reactivity and experimental effects
* external -  
    * threats
        * using samples that are not representative of the population
        * insufficient participants
        * non-representative test cases

**types of experiment (not tested)**
* true experiment vs field experiment
    * true = lab = controlled environment = unrealistic settings
    * field = lesser control = realistic settings = results can be influence by external factors
* experimental design - *the way in which the experiment was designed. e.g. use of randomisation? use of control groups? number of experimental groups or pretesting of participants etc.*
    * true or lab experiments - *high control but possibly unrealistic settings*
    * quasi-experiments aka field experiments - *more realistic setting but lesser control due to the external factors that may influence the experiment result*

**conditions to prove causality**
* correlation - relationship between independent and dependent variable
* time order - cause precedes effect in time (values of iv change then values of dv change). the cause and effect is after the treatment (e.g. fever, take medicine and temperature cools down)
* rule out other possible explanations (only the two variables causes the effect, no other elements factors in which is why it is a controlled experiment)

**steps for designing and conducting an experiment**
1. select relevant variables
2. specify levels of treatment
3. ensure control of experimental environment
4. choose the experimental design
5. select and assign participants
6. pilot test, revise, test - pretesting of procedures as well as instruments
7. analyse data

**advantages & disadvantages of experiment**
* advantages
    * well established method
    * only way to demonstrate cause-effect relationship
    * able to repeat experiments and extend results across people, time and situations.
* disadvantages
    * artificiality - limits the ability to generalise
    * impossible to control all parameters
    * difficult to recruit representative samples

additional materials:  
[8 Main Advantages and Disadvantages of Experimental Research](https://greengarageblog.org/8-main-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-experimental-research)

* the `aim` of experimental research is to predict phenomenons
* this is where a researcher manipulates one variable and controls or randomizers the rest of the variables
* advantages
    * able to control variables
    * determining cause and effect relationship is easy
    * provides better results
* disadvantages
    * creates artifical situations e.g. controlling irrelevant variables in which creates a situation that is artificial
